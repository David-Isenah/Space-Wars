# Space-Wars

This is real time strategy game where the player acts as a commander, ordering units around until all enemy main bases have been destroyed. The player can control(possess) some of its units manually playing as that unit. The game also comes with an editor for you to make your own levels.

This project is still a work in progress and is currently abandoned at the moment, but I might come back to it later. You can check out the demo showcase in release.
